# Rahul Sahay — Snowflake Data Superhero 2026

I believe being a Data Superhero is about responsibility, not heroics — building trust in data, enabling others, and focusing on strong foundations before advanced analytics or AI.

I work as a Snowflake-centric technical pre-sales and solution engineering leader, actively contributing to the Snowflake and broader data community.
