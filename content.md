## Writing, shared artifacts & knowledge reuse (Medium, LinkedIn, GitHub)

Over the last year, my primary focus has been on **Snowflake community building, events, and enablement**, rather than long-form writing. Because of this, I have only recently started writing more actively on Medium.

Alongside Medium, I am a **frequent writer on LinkedIn**, where most of the community conversations naturally happen.

🔗 **LinkedIn:**

My LinkedIn articles and posts usually originate from:
- Snowflake community discussions  
- Questions raised during user groups and events  
- Learnings from enablement sessions, demos, and customer conversations  

These are intentionally written in a conversational, practical style — meant to trigger discussion and shared learning rather than polished theory.

## GitHub (session material, demos, and reusable references)

I use GitHub primarily as a **sharing and enablement space**, not as a portfolio. Repositories and wiki pages are created to support talks, demos, and community conversations.

🔗 **GitHub – Snowflake BUILD session material (Wiki):**  
https://github.com/rahulsahay123/snowflake-build-2025/wiki

This GitHub space includes:
- Session structure and flow  
- Architecture and concept breakdowns  
- References and supporting material  
- Starting points for extending demos and use cases  

The focus is on making material easy to revisit, reuse, and adapt by others.

## Looking ahead (intentional focus)

Going forward, I plan to build a **stronger and more consistent presence** across:
- Medium blogs focused on Snowflake, data foundations, and agentic patterns  
- LinkedIn articles that amplify community discussions and learnings  
- GitHub artifacts that support talks, demos, and community learning  
- Podcast-style conversations around real Snowflake adoption stories  

This is a natural next step — amplifying the community foundation already in place through more structured and reusable content.

## Why this matters to my Data Superhero mindset

The Data Superhero mindset values strengthening the ecosystem over individual visibility. Writing, shared artifacts, and open repositories are my way of scaling what I learn from the community and giving it back in a form others can actually use.

For me, content is successful when it reduces friction for someone else — not when it simply gets views.
