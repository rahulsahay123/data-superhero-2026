## Key speaking engagements (Snowflake ecosystem)

My speaking engagements within the Snowflake ecosystem have largely focused on one theme — **structuring intelligence using agents on Snowflake**, with strong data foundations, governance, and practical enablement.

Rather than treating sessions as standalone talks, I try to design them so the audience walks away with reusable structures, concepts, and reference material.

### 🗓️ 23 August 2025 — Snowflake User Group Hyderabad (Prolifics)
**Role:** Speaker  
**Topic:** *Structuring Intelligence – How to build agentic applications on Snowflake*

This session explored how teams can move beyond dashboards and start building agentic applications on Snowflake, without compromising on trust, governance, or clarity.

The discussion covered:
- How to break down an agentic use case into data, context, and actions
- Where Snowflake fits in the agentic loop (data platform, governance, orchestration)
- Why strong data structures and access controls matter even more for AI-driven use cases
- Common misconceptions around “AI-first” approaches

To ensure the learning extended beyond the session, I created a shared Claude artifact for the audience that included:
- Session structure and flow
- Core concepts explained in simple terms
- Suggested data structures on Snowflake
- FAQs discussed during the session
- Demo outline and references

### 🗓️ 8 December 2025 — Snowflake BUILD, Bangalore
**Role:** Speaker  
**Topic:** *Structuring Intelligence using Snowflake Intelligence – Claim Assistant*

At Snowflake BUILD Bangalore, I presented a practitioner-focused session on structuring intelligence using Snowflake Intelligence, anchored around a real-world **Claim Assistant** use case.

The session focused on:
- Using Snowflake Intelligence beyond text-to-SQL scenarios
- Structuring data, context, and access for intelligent applications
- Designing an end-to-end flow for a Claim Assistant use case
- Why lineage, governance, and data foundations become critical as AI adoption scales

To make the session reusable beyond the event, I shared a GitHub Wiki with the audience, which included:
- Session structure and flow
- Architecture and concept breakdown
- References and supporting material
- Pointers for extending the use case further

## Why these sessions matter to my Data Superhero mindset

Both sessions were designed with the same intent — **enablement via hands-on demo suported by presentation**.

By sharing real use cases, reusable artifacts, and honest design considerations, I try to help practitioners:
- Build confidence using Snowflake for advanced use cases
- Avoid common pitfalls when combining data platforms and AI
- Think long-term about trust, governance, and scalability

For me, the success of these sessions is not measured by attendance, but by how many people can actually apply the ideas after the event.
