## Snowflake ecosystem involvement (chronological)

My involvement with the Snowflake ecosystem has grown steadily over time — across learning, contribution, enablement, and community support. Below is a chronological view of key touchpoints.

I participated in the Snowflake GenAI Specialty certification program as part of the content contribution process. This included:
- Item writing
- Content review
- Item review discussions  
- Working closely with Snowflake SMEs, including Avan Aziz

While I have not received the official SME badge yet, the experience gave me deeper insight into how Snowflake approaches GenAI concepts with responsibility, clarity, and real-world relevance.
